An Android implementation of an OpenGL waving texture flag effect. Adaptation of the OpenGL tutorial from NeHe (http://nehe.gamedev.net/tutorial/flag_effect_%28waving_texture%29/16002/)

This is used as the basis for the Indian Flag Live Wallpaper available on the Android Market (https://market.android.com/details?id=com.techionsoft.android.wavingflag)
