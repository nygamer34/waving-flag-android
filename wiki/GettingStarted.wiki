= Introduction =

This project is an Android OpenGL ES 1.0 implementation of a flag that waves and wiggles. This demonstrates the use of:
 * GLSurfaceView in Android
 * Use of textures


= Getting Started =

Use a subversion client for your platform to checkout the source.  Subclipse plugin for Eclipse is highly recommended to import the sources directly into Eclipse.

Once the sources are downloaded, clean and build the project, and deploy to a device or emulator having Android 2.1 (API level 7) or above.  Might be sluggish on the emulator and testing on a real device is recommended.
